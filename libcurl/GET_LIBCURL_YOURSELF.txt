you need to get libcurl yourself and unzip it to this directory
get it here: http://curl.haxx.se/download.html

you'll want to get a source archive
(tested version is 7.28 - 10.10.2012 http://curl.haxx.se/download/curl-7.28.0.zip )

unzip the folder in the zip into this directory.

after unzipping, this location should contain the following directories (amoung others):
* include
* lib
* src
